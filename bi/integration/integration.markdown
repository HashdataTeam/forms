# Integration

The first step in using **Hashdata Business Intelligence** is to 
integrate with **Hashdata Forms**, so that data is 
exported and analyzed. Next we will show you step by step 
how to perform the integration.

Integration is necessary for both systems to communicate 
and thus the data collected through Hashdata Forms can 
be accessed through Hashdata Business Intelligence. To 
do this, follow the steps below:

**1) Select agregation**

**4) Assign an index name and name the questions**

Fill in the question names in the "field name export". It 
is also possible to fill in automatically by selecting 
the button in the lower left corner.

**Attention: Do not remove the number automatically 
generated by the system.** In the case of the example, 
the number is 394.

and the data is ready to be analyzed in Hashdata BI.
