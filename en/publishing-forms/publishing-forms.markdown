# Publishing forms

The publication of forms is an essential step in the flow of 
information in Hashdata. Every form when it is being created 
is automatically saved as a draft, this means that any answers 
that are given in that mode will be discarded. For the form to 
start receiving collections and validating them, it is 
necessary to publish the form.
To perform this procedure, click on the “publish” button on 
the form editing screen.
