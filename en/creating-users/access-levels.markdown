# Access levels

The access levels are the permissions attributed to 
the users. Below, there is a description of each one of 
them. It is important to remember that the permissions 
are cumulative – that is, it is possible to assign more 
than one (or all) to a single user.

**Perform data collection** – This is a basic permission 
level, in which the user is only able to collect data 
in the app.

**View collected data** – Also a basic permission level, in 
which the users are able to view the data collected.

**Manage collected data** – The users are able to manage the 
collected data.

**Manage users** – The user is able to manage other users, 
creating or deleting them, as well as generating pre-sign 
up links and so on.
 
**Manage permissions** – The user is able to establish the 
access level of other users in the system.

**Manage Forms** – The user is able to manage forms, creating, 
editing, publishing, archiving, and attributing them to 
users, etc. 

**Manage integration (systems)** – The user has access to 
integration scripts on Hashdata, as well as to integration 
with other systems – for instance, the Qlikview.

**ATTENTION! When managing the access levels of a 
certain user, make sure that the selected level really 
is the desired level. A user with all permissions gains 
the status of super user, being able to make any changes 
to the access account, including deleting information 
permanently.**
