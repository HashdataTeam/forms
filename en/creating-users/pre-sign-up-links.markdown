# Pre-sign up links
(screen: users >> create pre-registration link >> 
create new link)

In this mode, the account managers pre-sets the access 
levels desired and a link is generated automatically. 
From this link, anyone who accesses it is able to fill 
the fields with their information. That way, if the 
manager needs to register hundreds of users who are 
only supposed to collect data, a simple alternative is 
to assign the option “perform data collection” to all 
users registered via this link.

After clicking on “save”, the link will be generated:

All users, whether created via link or manually, 
will appear on the managing screens – user manager 
screen or attribution of forms to a user.
