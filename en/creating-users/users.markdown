# Creating users

(Screen: users >> create user )

The functionality “create user” assigns login and 
password to a newly created user. From these 
credentials, it is possible to access them system and, 
consequently, the forms made available by the account 
manager. From there, it is possible to perform data 
collection and access other functionalities in the 
system, depending on how it has been adjusted. 
It is recommended that the usernames correspond to the 
users’ e-mails because the system (in its entirety) 
does not accept users with the same name. Apart from 
the credentials, it is also necessary to assign an 
access level to the brand new user, which may vary 
according to the manager’s needs.
