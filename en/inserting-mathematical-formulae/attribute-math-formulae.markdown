On the field “formula/expression”, insert the desired 
formula. On the case of the example - 
(S11+S12+S13).S21 – the signs supposed to be used are:

Operation | Symbol
------------ | -------------
addition | +
Subtraction | -
Division | /
Multiplication | .

All questions that had been through step 1 will appear 
on the field “variables available” and will be available 
to the accounts.
