# Inserting mathematical formulae

The questions of the type “mathematical formula” 
are used to perform arithmetical calculations from 
the answers given. This type of question is attributed 
to multiple choice questions with only one answer or 
questions of evaluation/satisfaction. There are, 
fundamentally, two steps to create a question like 
this: 1) attributing values to the answers of a 
multiple choice question with only one answer or of 
evaluation/satisfaction and 2) performing the desired 
calculation, which will be detailed below.
