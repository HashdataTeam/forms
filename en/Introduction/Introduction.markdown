# Introduction

The Hashdata is an online platform that consists of a software
and an app that works as complementary tool to collect data. 
It also works offline and is available on Android (playstore), 
IOS (Appstore) and Windows 10 (contact us). There are five 
fundamental steps to using the system:

1.	[Creating forms](/en/forms/creating-forms/creating_forms)
1.	[Creating users](/en/creating-users/users)
1.	[Attributing forms to users](/en/attributing-forms-to-users/attributing-forms-to-users)
1.	[Publishing forms](/en/forms/publishing-forms/publishing-forms)
1.	[Analyzing data](/en/forms/analyzing-data/analyzing-data)

All other functionalities are associated to one or more of these steps, which will be explained throughout this tutorial.
