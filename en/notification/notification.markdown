# Notifications system

The notification system has two fundamental functions: 
1) working as a reminder, notifying users that a certain 
collection must be performed or sending several reminder 
notices (**Scheduling notifications**) and 2) notifying users 
when a certain event occurs (**Event notifications**). In the 
following sections, we will address these two uses of the 
tool.

## 1) Scheduling notifications

In the form editing screen, select "Scheduling notifications":


![notification1](/en/assets/images/notification1.png)

Then select "add notification":

![notification2](/en/assets/images/notification2.png)


The notification screen by scheduling will appear, where 
it is possible to enter a title for the notification **(1)**, the 
message content **(2)** and the triggering mechanism **(3)**, configuring 
time, date and timezone, as shown in the figure below:

![notification3](/en/assets/images/notification3.png)

![notification4](/en/assets/images/notification4.png)


After configuring items **(1)**, **(2)** and **(3)**, select "recipients" 
to set up who will receive the notification created and the 
notification method: email or push (via app) or both.

## Set up the recipients

To notify users via email, select the check 
box ![notification8](/en/assets/images/notification8.png) 
corresponding to the user.To notify users via App, select 
the check box
![notification9](/en/assets/images/notification9.png)
corresponding to the user. It is also possible to check 
both, as in the example below: 

![notification5](/en/assets/images/notification5.png)

If the icon ![notification6](/en/assets/images/notification6.png) 
appears in the e-mail field instead of the checkbox, it 
means that the e-mail has not been confirmed by the user. 
In this case, you must confirm the email to show the check 
box (when an email is registered in the system when the user 
is created, hashdata sends an automatic confirmation email).

If the icon ![notification7](/en/assets/images/notification7.png)
appears in the app field instead of the checkbox, it means 
that the user does not have the app installed. In this 
case, you must install the App to show the check box.

## 2) Event notifications

In the form editing screen, select “Event notifications”:

![notification10](/en/assets/images/notification10.png)

Then select “add notification”:

![notification11](/en/assets/images/notification11.png)

Select the trigger type for the notification:

![notification12](/en/assets/images/notification12.png)

In the **"Add new collection"** trigger, the notification
will be triggered every time a collection is performed.

In the **"Update collection"** trigger, the notification will 
be triggered every time a collection already made is 
modified.

In the **"Delete collection"** trigger, the notification 
will be triggered every time a collection is deleted on 
the form.

In addition to these options, it is possible to 
customize the events by selecting "yes" in the trigger 
conditions, as shown in the image below:

![notification13](/en/assets/images/notification13.png)

It is possible to quantify the conditions. Thus, it is 
possible to select whether **"all conditions must be true"**, 
**"at least one condition must be true"** or if **"no conditions 
must be true".** 

After selecting the logical operator, it is possible to 
create specific conditions for each of the questions by the
button ![notification16](/en/assets/images/notification16.png). 

In the example below, it is easy to see that the system will 
trigger the notification if a collection is made by the 
auditor Eric, in the accounting department: 

![notification14](/en/assets/images/notification14.png)

There are many possibilities for combining and there are 
no limits on the number of conditions, just follow the 
two steps: **(1)** select the logical operator and 
**(2)** select the condition or conditions to be satisfied,
as in the example above.

After configuring items **(1)** and **(2)**, select 
“recipients” to set up who will receive the notification 
created and the notification method: email or push 
(via app) or both.

## Set up the recipients

To notify users via email, select the check 
box ![notification8](/en/assets/images/notification8.png) 
corresponding to the user.To notify users via App, select 
the check box
![notification9](/en/assets/images/notification9.png)
corresponding to the user. It is also possible to check 
both, as in the example below: 

![notification5](/en/assets/images/notification5.png)

If the icon ![notification6](/en/assets/images/notification6.png) 
appears in the e-mail field instead of the checkbox, it 
means that the e-mail has not been confirmed by the user. 
In this case, you must confirm the email to show the check 
box (when an email is registered in the system when the user 
is created, hashdata sends an automatic confirmation email).

If the icon ![notification7](/en/assets/images/notification7.png)
appears in the app field instead of the checkbox, it means 
that the user does not have the app installed. In this 
case, you must install the App to show the check box.
