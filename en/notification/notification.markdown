# Notification system

The notification system has two fundamental functions: 
1) working as a reminder, notifying users that a certain 
collection must be performed or sending several reminder 
notices (**Scheduling notifications**) and 2) notifying users 
when a certain event occurs (**Event notifications**). In the 
following sections, we will address these two uses of the 
tool.

## 1) Scheduling notifications

In the form editing screen, select "scheduling notifications":


![notification1](/en/assets/images/notification1.png)

Then select "add notification":

![notification2](/en/assets/images/notification2.png)


The notification screen by scheduling will appear, where 
it is possible to enter a title for the notification **(1)**, the 
message content **(2)** and the triggering mechanism **(3)**, configuring 
time, date and timezone, as shown in the figure below:

![notification4](/en/assets/images/notification4.png)


After configuring items **(1)**, **(2)** and **(3)**, select "recipients" 
to set up who will receive the notification created and the 
notification method: email or push (via app).

## Event notifications

If the button ![notification6](/en/assets/images/notification6.png) 
appears in the e-mail field, it means that the e-mail has 
not been confirmed by the user. In this case, you must 
confirm the email to show the check box (when an email is 
registered in the system when the user is created, hashdata 
sends an automatic confirmation email).

If the button ![notification7](/en/assets/images/notification7.png)
appears in the app field, it means that the user does 
not have the app installed. In this case, you must 
confirm install the App to show the check box.
