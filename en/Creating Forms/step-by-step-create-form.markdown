All information on Hashdata revolves around the forms. Therefore, all data is to be collected from them. In order to create a form, click on “forms” and then on “new form”.  From there, fill the blank spaces with administrative data and create questions by clicking on “add new question” and “add add-on”. On the first case, when using the button “add new question”, all questions must follow the same creation logic. The user must establish a question and a desired answer type. The question is determined by the user, and the available answer types are: text, number, date, hour, date and hour (combined), multiple choice with one possible answer, multiple choice with more than one answer, formatted field (pre-established by the user), signature, image and location. By clicking on “add add-ons”, it is possible to show images, texts, add mathematical formulae and hide fields. For further details, check the following step-by-step.
