# Creating Forms
---

All information on Hashdata revolves around the forms. 
Therefore, all data is to be collected from them. 
In order to create a form, click on “forms” and then on 
“new form”.  

From there, fill the blank spaces with administrative data 
and create questions by clicking on “add new question” and 
“add add-on”. On the first case, when using the button “add 
new question”, all questions must follow the same creation 
logic. The user must establish a question and a desired 
answer type. 
The question is determined by the user, and the available 
answer types are: text, number, date, hour, date and hour 
(combined), multiple choice with one possible answer, 
multiple choice with more than one answer, formatted field 
(pre-established by the user), signature, image and location.

# Step-by-step on how to create a form:

1) Forms

![forms1](/en/assets/images/forms1.png)

2) Create new form

![forms2](/en/assets/images/forms2.png)

3) Fill in the fields with the necessary information 
and click on “continue”.

![forms3](/en/assets/images/forms3.png)

Pay attention to the following boxes:

![forms4](/en/assets/images/forms4.png)

If you check the box “WEB Page”, it will be possible 
to perform the collection via web, from a link generate 
automatically when the form is published, or via QR code.

![forms5](/en/assets/images/forms5.png)
 
If you check the box “Form on mobile device”, the 
collection will be performed via app. It must be 
downloaded on the Playstore or Appstore (there is also 
an available version on Windows 10). In that case, the 
manager creates the users and assigns the access to 
them after finishing the form (refer to “how to creater 
users”). Select the users to which you wish to give 
access and publish the form, as suggested by the 
following picture: 
 
![forms6](/en/assets/images/forms6.png)
 
## How to create questions via the “Add questions” button
 
There are two buttons to create questions on Hashdata: 
“add questions” and “add add-ons”. In this section, we 
will explain the use of the button “add questions”, 
which is more widely used and which is located in the 
editing forms screen. In there, it is possible to find 
questions of the following types: text, number, masked 
field, date, date and time, signature, image (taking 
pictures), location (GPS), multiple choice (only one 
answer), multiple choice (more than one answer), 
rated/evaluation/satisfaction.
 
![forms7](/en/assets/images/forms7.png)
 
All questions created from the button “Add question” 
must follow the same creation procedure: 1) inserting 
the question text, which is what the reader will see 
and 2) the desired type of question. That way, for a 
text-type question, for instance, you may ask in 
1) what is your name? and in 2) select the text type, 
as suggested by the following image:
 
![forms8](/en/assets/images/forms8.png)
  
If the type of the question is image, for example, 
insert 1) question text (e.g. “take a picture”) and 
2) select the image type, as follows:
  
![forms9](/en/assets/images/forms9.png)
  
This process is repeated for any other question type.
  
## How to create questions via the “Add add-ons” button

 
![forms10](/en/assets/images/forms10.png)
   
By using the button “Add add-ons”, it is possible 
to show images to the respondent, exhibit texts and 
attribute mathematical formulae to multiple choice 
questions. The process to exhibit texts and images 
is similar. This type of question is used, in general, 
to show some recommendation, procedure, instructions, 
so on. It is important to notice that these are 
show-only questions, so it is not possible to answer 
them – only to view the displayed text or image.
   
![forms11](/en/assets/images/forms11.png)
   
It is necessary to insert the question title 
(which may or may not be displayed to the user) and, 
then, fill the text field with the text and set it 
according to your needs. When it is done, save it.
   
![forms12](/en/assets/images/forms12.png)
   
To create an image, the process is similar: fill 
the box with the question title, choose if the title 
must be displayer to the respondent, set the 
alignment, choose the image and save.

# Inserting mathematical formulae

The questions of the type “mathematical formula” 
are used to perform arithmetical calculations from 
the answers given. This type of question is attributed 
to multiple choice questions with only one answer or 
questions of evaluation/satisfaction. There are, 
fundamentally, two steps to create a question like 
this: 1) attributing values to the answers of a 
multiple choice question with only one answer or of 
evaluation/satisfaction and 2) performing the desired 
calculation, which will be detailed below. 

## 1) How to attribute values to answers in a question

Open the desired question (multiple choice with a 
single answer or evaluation/satisfaction) or create 
a new question of this kind and click in “assign values 
to response”.

![forms14](/en/assets/images/forms14.png)

Insert the desired values after the “=” sign and 
name the question in the field “variable name for 
this question”, as the following image suggests. 
After it is done, save the question. 

![forms15](/en/assets/images/forms15.png)

## How to attribute mathematical formulae to questions with values

After performing the first step on all questions to be 
calculated, it is time to create the mathematical 
formulae. Click on “add add-ons” and, then, on 
“mathematical formula”.

![forms16](/en/assets/images/forms16.png)

The following editing layout will appear:

![forms17](/en/assets/images/forms17.png)

On the field “formula/expression”, insert the desired 
formula. On the case of the example - 
(S11+S12+S13).S21 – the signs supposed to be used are:

Operation | Symbol
------------ | -------------
addition | +
Subtraction | -
Division | /
Multiplication | .

All questions that had been through step 1 will appear 
on the field “variables available” and will be available 
to the accounts.

# Creating users

(Screen: users >> create user )

The functionality “create user” assigns login and 
password to a newly created user. From these 
credentials, it is possible to access them system and, 
consequently, the forms made available by the account 
manager. From there, it is possible to perform data 
collection and access other functionalities in the 
system, depending on how it has been adjusted. 
It is recommended that the usernames correspond to the 
users’ e-mails because the system (in its entirety) 
does not accept users with the same name. Apart from 
the credentials, it is also necessary to assign an 
access level to the brand new user, which may vary 
according to the manager’s needs.

## Access levels

The access levels are the permissions attributed to 
the users. Below, there is a description of each one of 
them. It is important to remember that the permissions 
are cumulative – that is, it is possible to assign more 
than one (or all) to a single user. 

![forms19](/en/assets/images/forms19.png)

**Perform data collection** – This is a basic permission 
level, in which the user is only able to collect data 
in the app.

**View collected data** – Also a basic permission level, in 
which the users are able to view the data collected.

**Manage collected data** – The users are able to manage the 
collected data.

**Manage users** – The user is able to manage other users, 
creating or deleting them, as well as generating pre-sign 
up links and so on.
 
**Manage permissions** – The user is able to establish the 
access level of other users in the system.

**Manage Forms** – The user is able to manage forms, creating, 
editing, publishing, archiving, and attributing them to 
users, etc. 

**Manage integration (systems)** – The user has access to 
integration scripts on Hashdata, as well as to integration 
with other systems – for instance, the Qlikview.

**ATTENTION! When managing the access levels of a 
certain user, make sure that the selected level really 
is the desired level. A user with all permissions gains 
the status of super user, being able to make any changes 
to the access account, including deleting information 
permanently.**  

## Creating users via account manager or via user with managing permissions 

(Screen: users >> create user)
In this mode, the account manager creates each user 
(generating login and password) and attributes the access 
levels manually. 

![forms20](/en/assets/images/forms20.png)

As they are created, the users appear in the managing 
screen, where it is possible to make changes later:

![forms21](/en/assets/images/forms21.png)

## Pre-sign up links
(screen: users >> create pre-registration link >> 
create new link)

In this mode, the account managers pre-sets the access 
levels desired and a link is generated automatically. 
From this link, anyone who accesses it is able to fill 
the fields with their information. That way, if the 
manager needs to register hundreds of users who are 
only supposed to collect data, a simple alternative is 
to assign the option “perform data collection” to all 
users registered via this link. 


![forms22](/en/assets/images/forms22.png)

After clicking on “save”, the link will be generated:

![forms23](/en/assets/images/forms23.png)

All users, whether created via link or manually, 
will appear on the managing screens – user manager 
screen or attribution of forms to a user. 

## Attributing forms to users

(screen: forms >> publications)

There are two ways of attributing forms to users: 
**1) via the screen of the form to be accessed** or **2) 
via the screen of the user to be granted access.**

## 1) Access via forms screen

Open the form. If it is already published, click on 
“Authorized Users”

![forms24](/en/assets/images/forms24.png)

Attribute this form to the desired user. It is 
possible to attribute forms to user or organizational 
units, as the following image suggests:

![forms25](/en/assets/images/forms25.png)

If the form has not been published yet, click on 
“publish”.

![forms26](/en/assets/images/forms26.png)

Select the users individually or by organizational units.

![forms27](/en/assets/images/forms27.png)

## 2) Access via users screen

(Screen: users)
Open the user screen and click on the 
button ![button](/en/assets/images/button.png), next 
to the user to which a form must be linked. Then, 
click on “forms acess”.


![forms28](/en/assets/images/forms28.png)

Attribute the desired forms or folders.

# Analyzing data

The analysis of data is the resulting process of the 
data collection; There are two different ways to perform 
this analysis: 1) graphical analysis and 2) answer tables. 
Both are closely related, since it is possible to create 
filters in a screen and generate reports in the other and 
vice-versa. They can be accessed via the screen reports 
on the initial menu or via the editing screen in the form.

## Access via reports screen

(screen: reports)

Access via the reports screen on the initial menu:

![forms31](/en/assets/images/forms31.png)


![forms32](/en/assets/images/forms32.png)

The graphical analysis will be accessed via the editing screen in the desired form. 
On the top right corner, click on more >> graphical analysis. 

![forms33](/en/assets/images/forms33.png)

## Access via editing screen

(screen: forms >> choosing a form >> more >> graphical 
analysis of answer)


![forms34](/en/assets/images/forms34.png)

![forms35](/en/assets/images/forms35.png)

## Answer table

(screen: forms >> choose the form to be analyzed >> more >> 
answer table)

By clicking on “answer table”, it is possible to generate 
collection reports in PDF or export the data in XLS or CSV.


![forms36](/en/assets/images/forms36.png)

![forms37](/en/assets/images/forms37.png)

It is possible to generate a general report or a report 
filtered by period: 

![forms38](/en/assets/images/forms38.png)
