#  Creating Forms
All information on Hashdata revolves around the forms. 
Therefore, all data is to be collected from them. In order 
to create a form, click on “forms” and then on “new form”. 
From there, fill the blank spaces with administrative data
and create questions by clicking on “add new question” and
“add add-on”. On the first case, when using the button
“add new question”, all questions must follow the same
creation logic. The user must establish a question and
a desired answer type. The question is determined by 
the user, and the available answer types are: text, 
number, date, hour, date and hour (combined), multiple 
choice with one possible answer, multiple choice with 
more than one answer, formatted field (pre-established by 
the user), signature, image and location. By clicking on 
“add add-ons”, it is possible to show images, texts, add 
mathematical formulae and hide fields. For further 
details, check the following step-by-step.

If you check the box “WEB Page”, it will be possible 
to perform the collection via web, from a link generate 
automatically when the form is published, or via QR code.

 If you check the box “Form on mobile device”, the 
 collection will be performed via app. It must be 
 downloaded on the Playstore or Appstore (there is also 
 an available version on Windows 10). In that case, the 
 manager creates the users and assigns the access to 
 them after finishing the form (refer to “how to creater 
 users”). Select the users to which you wish to give 
 access and publish the form, as suggested by the 
 following picture:
