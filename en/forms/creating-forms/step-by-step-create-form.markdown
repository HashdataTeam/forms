If you check the box “Form on mobile device”, the 
collection will be performed via app. It must be 
downloaded on the Playstore or Appstore (there is also 
an available version on Windows 10). In that case, the 
manager creates the users and assigns the access to 
them after finishing the form (refer to “how to creater 
users”). Select the users to which you wish to give 
access and publish the form, as suggested by the
