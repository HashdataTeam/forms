# Create questions via the “Add add-ons” button

By using the button “Add add-ons”, it is possible 
to show images to the respondent, exhibit texts and 
attribute mathematical formulae to multiple choice 
questions. The process to exhibit texts and images 
is similar. This type of question is used, in general, 
to show some recommendation, procedure, instructions, 
so on. It is important to notice that these are 
show-only questions, so it is not possible to answer 
them – only to view the displayed text or image.

It is necessary to insert the question title 
(which may or may not be displayed to the user) and, 
then, fill the text field with the text and set it 
according to your needs. When it is done, save it.

To create an image, the process is similar: fill 
the box with the question title, choose if the title 
must be displayer to the respondent, set the 
alignment, choose the image and save.
