# Smart forms: navigation logic and display logic.

The functionalities "smart forms" were developed so that 
your form makes decisions automatically and is composed by 
the navigation logic and the display logic. When enabled, 
the Navigation Logic skips questions from the answers given 
to a previous question and the display logic displays 
questions from pre-established pre-conditions by the user.

To enable smart forms functionality go to:

Then the icons will be activated:

## Navigation logic

Select ![logic7](/en/assets/images/logic7.png) to activate 
the navigation logic options.

There are two steps to configure the navigation logic **(1)** 
select the desired operator and **(2)** the question to which 
the user will be directed. This procedure must be performed 
on all response options. In the case of the example below, 
if the option "Ground Beef" is checked, the respondent will 
be directed to question 5 "5S Area".

## Display logic

Select ![logic6](/en/assets/images/logic6.png) to activate 
the navigation logic options. Then the screen will appear:

Select ![notification16](/en/assets/images/notification16.png) 
to assign a new viewing condition and choose
some of the options: "any", "all" or "none", 
as in the image above.
There are many possibilities for combining and there are 
no limits on the number of conditions, just follow the two 
steps: **(3)** select the logical operator and **(4)** select the 
condition or conditions to be satisfied, as in the example 
below.

Neste caso a questão "14. Are there waste sources such 
as water, power (lights not working, AC units down), 
etc...?" só irá aparecer se "todas" as condições forem 
verdadeiras:  se o auditor for Bruce e o departamento for 
Human Resources.
